                    <br/>
                    In 1992, Rochestarian Giuseppe Testaverde visited Avellino, Italy, the homeland of his
                    family. During his time in Avellino he was able to sample many of the delicious,
                    traditional food offerings but what impacted him most of all were the local pizzerias.
                    Each one served a variety of traditional Neapolitan pizzas and each with their own
                    special touch. His favorite turned out to be one owned by a second cousin Carlo
                    Cucina. The visit with his cousin proved to be life changing! Giuseppe decided to stay
                    with Carlo and his family to learn the art of pizza making…the “Napolitan” way! With
                    Carlo’s undying love and support, Giuseppe ventured off to Brooklyn, NY to begin his
                    own traditional pizzeria…A’ Pizza Giuseppe.

                As the years passed and his own family grew he decided to expand the business and
                share his passion and traditions in new locales. In 1998 he opened a restaurant in
                Penfield, a suburb of Rochester, NY. The Italian-American community in this upstate
                town were thrilled! “Finally, a real pizza place…” was being heard around town! But,
                you’ll only find Giuseppe in this pizzeria on a Saturday night. His son Marco runs the
                show in this location and Giuseppe only stops in for a glass of wine and a slice or two of
                Diavola.

                In 2002, Giuseppe brought A’Giuseppe Pizza to the West side...Greece that is! His son Matteo is
                the true pizzaiola in the family and he has taken over at the newest location. This spot
                has decor with a new modern flair that complements the traditional pizze perfectly. It
                has become a place to be for happy hour on a Friday evening or for watching the
                soccer games on Sunday afternoon. If you stop by early enough on Sunday, you
                probably find Giuseppe shouting for Napoli in between sips of his espresso!
